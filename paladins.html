		<p>Paladins: Champions of the Realm is a free-to-play online Hero shooter video game by Hi-Rez Studios. The game was developed by Evil Mojo Games, an internal studio of Hi-Rez, and was released in 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. </p>

		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<p>
			Paladins provides various characters, called Champions, for the players to choose during their gaming sessions. Each of these Champions falls into one of the following categories: Front Line, Damage, Support, and Flank. Being a team-based shooter, players must rely on strategy, character knowledge, coordination, and teamwork in order to attain victory. Players may use VGS, along with text and voice chat to communicate. A good team will have a balanced choice of classes that will support each other during the game.<br>

    <b>Front Line</b>: Heroes who serve as the anchor of the team, holding the front and protecting their allies. With high health pools and shielding capabilities, Front Line champions excel at blocking enemy fire and disrupting enemy objective captures, they are very effective at zoning out the enemy team after a wipe. <br><br>
    <b>Damage:</b> Combat Heroes who possess reliable and consistent damage outputs or large burst damage potential. Their damage, coupled with average health pools and decent mobility, make Damage champions ideal for skirmishes and extended firefights.<br><br>
    <b>Support:</b> Champions with high utility and healing abilities, the backbone of any team. Due to their healing capabilities that keep their allies in the fight, Support champions are very valuable allies.<br><br>
    <b>Flank:</b> Champions who excel at traversing the battlefield and getting behind enemy lines, eliminating vulnerable key targets. While most Flank heroes are relatively frail, having lower health pools than any other role, their excellent mobility and, at times, very effective weapons provide them with the means of escape and survival. While champions like Androxus and Lex can quickly dash behind you in a single move before you can react, that’s not all that Flank Champions can do. For instance, they can leap through the air or even turn invisible, like Skye.<br><br>

There are 42 champions in Paladins,[1] five of which are available from the start for new players to choose between. Additionally, four champions are also temporarily accessible for free on a two-week rotation. Players can permanently acquire additional champions through purchases using in-game currency.
